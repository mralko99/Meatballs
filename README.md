Meatballs is a web application born with the intent to **satiate** food-related needs of our clients, keeping an eye on the ambient and on the wallet, the whole with the ultimate goal to provide a healthy and tasty diet.
What Meatballs consists of is a user friendly chatbot who will supply many options for your diet, eventually taking into account food intolerances, ingredients you already possess and don't want to waste and many others features.

## Getting Started
It's possible to obtain a copy of the project by cloning the repository on Github.  

### Prerequisites

The Node.js modules you have to install in the project folder in order to get the application working are:

```
$ npm install express
$ npm install express-ws
$ npm install dotenv
$ npm install oauth
$ npm install express-session
$ npm install unirest
$ npm install swagger-ui-express
$ npm install request
$ npm install opener
$ npm install events
$ npm install mongoose
$ npm install twitter
```

The module dotenv, installed before through npm install dotenv, allows you to loads environment variables in a file called .env. The file .env contains all the sensitive data or credential you don't want to share with everyone.
Our .env file contains the following data:
```
CONSUMER_KEY
CONSUMER_SECRET
GOOGLE_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
MONGODB_URI
X_RAPIDAPI_HOST
X_RAPIDAPI_KEY
```
To interact with the application, it's necessary a socket chat.
